Templates folder may lag system
Templates folder can add back Windows functionality (new file) in Linux
Hidden folders do not show up on the dropdown
Files have spaces in their names, as it looks better in the context menus
The file extension does not show up in the context menu
I added a space to blank files, so that their extension would show up

This is a good reference for when I don't want to make a set of web searches to start programming or doing other tasks
